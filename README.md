This repo mostly covers a bunch of sample website building examples using HTML, css, javascript and pyscript

For game development most interesting one is games/python_webgl folder and games/python_webgl/scripts/geometry_animation.py is the python code that can use THREE js framework and deploy a character animation using GLTF (100% python code !)
